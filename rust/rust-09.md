At this point, you should have a pretty decent understanding of Rust syntax.
It went pretty fast, but you should have enough of a foundation to get started on at least the easier tasks for the [prediction/navigation engine](https://github.com/KMarshland/hab-predictor).

That said, there's plenty more to rust, especially regarding things like borrowing.
I highly recommend learning by doing: finding a simple project for yourself, and learning by doing (you can also learn by doing the predictor).
Finally, there are some good resources out there that go way more in-depth than I did; my favorite is probably [Rust by Example](https://rustbyexample.com/)

Happy coding!
