# HABMC Tutorials
HABMC is a massive codebase.
If it were a person, it would probably be a guy named Larry with a penchant for vacuuming up his roommate's binary-O's. 
Dammit Larry.

Provided here are three mostly-discrete tutorials: one about Ruby, the programming language, another about Rails, the framework, and the final one about HABMC itself.
Let's start with [the ruby one](ruby/ruby-01.md).
